README for the tangent distance implemetation

This implementation is mostly a result of the programming for my
diploma thesis written in 2000, which also contains more details and
relevant publications that this implementation is based on:

 D. Keysers. Approaches to Invariant Image Object Recognition. Diploma
 thesis, Lehrstuhl für Informatik VI, RWTH Aachen, Aachen, June 2000.
 (http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~keysers)


The sources should be rather self-explaining.
